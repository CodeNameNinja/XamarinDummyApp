## What is Xamarin?

Xamarin is a Microsoft-owned San Francisco, California-based software company founded in May 2011 by the engineers that created Mono, Mono for Android, and MonoTouch, which are cross-platform implementations of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and Common Language Specifications (often called Microsoft .NET). Xamarin allows C# developers to build native Android, iOS, and Windows apps with native user interfaces and share code across multiple platforms.

## What is Xamarin Forms?

Xamarin.Forms is a cross-platform UI toolkit that allows developers to efficiently create native user interfaces for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone from a single, shared C# codebase. Xamarin.Forms applications can also be written in XAML, which provides an intuitive design surface for layout, data binding, and other features.

## What is XAML?

XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) is a declarative markup language used to create User Interfaces (UI) in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and in Silverlight. It is also used in Windows Phone, Windows Store, Windows Runtime, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.

XAML is an XML-based language that is used to describe the structure and appearance of an application. XAML is used to create the user interface (UI) for an application. XAML is the primary language used to create user interfaces in WPF and Silverlight. XAML is also used to define the appearance of a page in a Windows Phone, Windows Store, Windows Runtime, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app.

XAML is a powerful, declarative language that makes it easy to define the appearance of an application. XAML is a markup language, which means that it uses tags to define the elements of the application. XAML is also an extensible language, which means that you can add your own custom tags to extend the language. The XAML language is a superset of the XML language. XAML is an XML-based language, which means that all XAML documents are valid XML documents.

## What is MVVM?

MVVM is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform. The view model of MVVM is a value converter, meaning that the view model is responsible for exposing (converting) the data

## Xamarin Form XAML Components.

### StackLayout.

StackLayout is a layout container that arranges child elements in a single vertical or horizontal line. The default orientation is vertical, but this can be changed by setting the Orientation property to Horizontal.

### Grid.

The Grid layout container arranges child elements into rows and columns. You can specify the row and column dimensions in one of two ways:

- By specifying the Height and Width of each row or column individually.
- By specifying the Height and Width of the entire Grid.
